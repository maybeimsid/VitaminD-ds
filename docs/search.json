Unlike many nutrients, vitamin D is produced in the body primarily through exposure to sunlight. Because of this, vitamin D levels are strongly influenced by environmental factors such as season, latitude, and lifestyle.\nIn countries like Canada, and particularly in cities such as Vancouver, sunlight exposure varies substantially throughout the year. This leads to noticeable seasonal patterns in vitamin D deficiency. Despite this, public health recommendations around vitamin D supplementation are often broad and uniform throughout the year. This raises an important question: can data science help identify who is most at risk of vitamin D deficiency, and when?"

    "section": "Why Vitamin D Deficiency Is a Seasonal Issue",
    "text": "Why Vitamin D Deficiency Is a Seasonal Issue\nVitamin D synthesis depends on exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation from sunlight. During summer months, longer days and higher sun angles make it easier for individuals to maintain sufficient vitamin D levels. In contrast, during fall and winter, UVB exposure drops sharply, especially at northern latitudes.\nData from the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS), published by Statistics Canada, show clear seasonal differences in vitamin D status. Approximately 40% of Canadians have vitamin D levels below recommended thresholds during winter, compared to around 25% during summer.\nOlder adults are particularly affected. Several population-level studies report that winter deficiency rates among adults over the age of 65 can exceed 45%, while rates among younger adults are substantially lower during summer months.\nVancouver presents an interesting case. While the city experiences relatively mild winters, frequent cloud cover and shorter daylight hours limit effective sunlight exposure. As a result, residents may face sustained seasonal risk even compared to other Canadian cities at similar latitudes."

    "section": "Why Averages Can Be Misleading",
    "text": "Why Averages Can Be Misleading\nPublic health summaries often rely on annual averages to describe population health. While averages are useful, they can hide important variation.\nFor example, an annual average vitamin D level might suggest that a population is generally sufficient. However, this same population may experience several months each year where a large fraction of individuals are deficient. In other words, a stable average can mask seasonal risk.\nData science encourages us to move beyond single summary statistics. By examining how values change over time and across subgroups, we can uncover patterns that are invisible in aggregated data. For instance, subgroup analysis may reveal that winter deficiency rates among seniors are nearly double those of younger adults, even if the overall population average appears acceptable."

    "text": "Exploring the Data: Real Seasonal and Age Comparisons\nA natural first step in a data science workflow is exploratory data analysis (EDA). In the context of vitamin D deficiency in Canada, this involves looking at how vitamin D status varies by factors such as season and age group.\n\nSeasonal Differences in Vitamin D Status\nThe chart below shows the percentage of Canadians at selected vitamin D cut-offs by season. According to Cycle 2 of the Canadian Health Measures Survey, about 40% of Canadians had vitamin D blood concentrations below the cut-off during winter, compared with 25% in summer. This pattern illustrates a strong seasonal effect that simple averages can hide, as a single yearly summary would not make clear when deficiency risk is highest.\n\nFigure: Percentage of Canadians at selected vitamin D cut-offs by season (Statistics Canada). :contentReferenceoaicite:0\n\n\nAge Differences in Vitamin D Status\nThe chart below shows the percentage of Canadians above and below a common vitamin D cut-off (50 nmol/L) by age group. This visualization reveals that certain age groups have higher rates of sufficient vitamin D levels than others. For example, young children and seniors tend to have higher proportions above the cut-off compared with adults aged 20–39.\n\nFigure: Percentage of Canadians above and below the vitamin D cut-off (50 nmol/L) by age group (Statistics Canada). :contentReferenceoaicite:1\nTogether, these charts make seasonal and demographic patterns in vitamin D status immediately clear."

    "section": "Adding Predictive Insight with Data Science",
    "text": "Adding Predictive Insight with Data Science\nWhile exploratory analysis helps us understand existing patterns, data science also allows us to anticipate future risk.\nUsing variables such as season, age, geographic location, and lifestyle factors, simple predictive models can estimate the likelihood that an individual’s vitamin D level falls below recommended thresholds during high-risk periods.\nFor example, a logistic regression model could estimate the probability that an individual experiences vitamin D deficiency during winter months. These predictions would not be used for medical diagnosis, but rather to support population-level planning and prevention.\nSuch a model might show that an older adult living in Vancouver has a significantly higher predicted risk of deficiency between November and March compared to a younger adult living in a sunnier region. This insight allows public health agencies to move from reactive responses to proactive strategies."

    "text": "Supporting Targeted Public Health Decisions\nOne of the main benefits of applying data science to this problem is the ability to design targeted interventions.\nInstead of issuing identical recommendations year-round, health authorities could adjust their guidance based on seasonal and demographic risk patterns identified through data analysis.\nExamples include: - Emphasizing supplementation campaigns in early fall, before deficiency rates peak - Focusing educational efforts on higher-risk groups such as seniors - Tailoring regional recommendations based on sunlight exposure and climate\nCompared to a one-size-fits-all approach, these targeted strategies allow for more efficient use of public health resources and reduce the likelihood that vulnerable populations are overlooked."

    "text": "Why This Is a Data Science Problem\nAlthough vitamin D deficiency is a health issue, the challenge lies in understanding patterns within complex, real-world data. Data science provides the tools to analyze these patterns, quantify risk, and translate findings into actionable insights.\nBy combining environmental data, demographic information, and health measurements, even relatively simple models and visualizations can meaningfully improve public health decision-making. In this way, data science complements medical expertise by ensuring that policies are informed by evidence rather than assumptions."

    "text": "Key Takeaways\nVitamin D deficiency is strongly seasonal, particularly in regions with limited winter sunlight such as Canada. Relying solely on annual averages can mask periods of elevated risk and obscure vulnerable populations.\nData science allows us to examine trends over time, compare subgroups, and anticipate future risk. Through exploratory analysis, visualization, and simple predictive modeling, data science supports more timely and targeted public health interventions, leading to better-informed decisions and more effective use of resources."
